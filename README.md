# Twitter Sentiments Analysis

This repository contains the code for my project on Twitter Sentiments Analysis, where I achieved an impressive accuracy of 94%. The project involves Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to analyze sentiments from Twitter data.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model that can accurately classify tweets into positive or negative sentiments. The model is trained on a large dataset of tweets, and it uses various NLP techniques to process and analyze the text data.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The project involves thorough preprocessing of the Twitter data, including cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.
- **Model Training**: The sentiment analysis model is trained using a machine learning algorithm, which is able to achieve high accuracy on the test data.
- **Performance Evaluation**: The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying sentiments.

## Getting Started

You can get started by cloning this repository and running the Jupyter notebook. The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayurdalvi/twitter-sentiments-analysis-nlp).

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).
